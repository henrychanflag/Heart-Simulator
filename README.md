# Heart-Simulator
Heart Simulator Project for QEH
THe project is an Arduino Uno based, which generate a pump motor control PWM pulses. The pulse frequency can be altered by the user, which imatiates the heart beat frequency.
The PWM duty cycle corresponds to the level of blood pressure. The higher the PWM duty cycle, the higher the pump motor and hence the "blood" pressure.
The product has a LCD interface to show the "blood pressure" and beat frequency. User can change the beat frequency as well as the "blood pressure".
The "blood pressure" is measured by the flow meter and therefore, increasing the pump motor speed will increase the flow.
The pump motor temperature is also monitored and shown in the LCD to avoid overheated.
